  ### Question
  You are a code review assistant. Analyze the above provided codebase and generate a detailed review covering the following aspects. Your output must always follow the exact JSON structure specified below, and the entire JSON output must be enclosed in a code block using triple backticks. Do not output any text outside of the code block.

  For each review category:
  - Only list a maximum of 3 issues. If more issues exist, list only the top 3 prioritized by severity (High, Medium, Low).
  - Each issue must include a detailed description with specific instructions such as file name, line number, variable names, and any other specific details.
  - Each issue must also include a "Severity" field (possible values: "High", "Medium", "Low").
  - Similarly, provide detailed recommendations that include specific instructions (file name, line number, variable names, etc.) along with a "Severity" field if applicable.
  - Include a disclaimer in your output stating: "Disclaimer: Only top 3 issues per category are shown, prioritized by severity. Additional issues may exist."

  The review must cover the following sections:

  1. **Naming Conventions**
    - Evaluate if variable, function, and class names are consistent, descriptive, and follow a standard naming pattern.
    - Provide detailed issues (with file name, line number, variable names, etc.) and recommendations.

  2. **Duplications**
    - Identify any duplicate code segments or functionality that could be refactored.
    - Provide detailed issues and recommendations.

  3. **Proper Comments for All Activities**
    - Check that every significant piece of code has clear, helpful comments.
    - Specifically review the sections for "Add functions" and "Delete functions" and comment on their adequacy.
    - Provide detailed issues and recommendations for each sub-section (AddFunctions and DeleteFunctions).

  4. **Memory Leaks**
    - Identify potential memory leaks such as unused arrays or improperly managed memory.
    - Provide detailed issues and recommendations.

  5. **Unnecessary Files**
    - Identify any files in the codebase that appear to be redundant or unnecessary.
    - Provide detailed issues and recommendations.

  6. **PR Summary**  
   - Review commit messages and pull request summaries for clarity and completeness.
   - Provide detailed issues and recommendations.

  7. **HIPAA/GDPR Compliance**  
   - Evaluate the code for compliance with HIPAA and GDPR regulations.
   - Provide separate detailed findings and recommendations for HIPAA and GDPR compliance.

  8. **Logging**  
   - Review the logging practices throughout the code.
   - Ensure that logs are meaningful and balanced.
   - Provide detailed issues and recommendations.

  9. **Refactoring**  
   - Provide overall recommendations to improve code structure, readability, and maintainability.
   - Identify areas where refactoring would significantly improve the code.
   - Provide detailed issues and recommendations.

  Your output must strictly adhere to the JSON structure provided below, including all specified keys. Do not output any text besides the JSON in a single code block.
