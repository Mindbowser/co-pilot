Core Concept:\n- Unlike data parallelism (splitting data across devices), model parallelism splits the model itself across different computational resources\n- Allows training of models larger than the memory of a single device\n\n2. Types of Model Parallelism:\na) Vertical Parallelism:\n- Splits layers or parts of layers across different devices\n- Each device processes a specific portion of the model\n- Useful for very large transformer architectures\n\nb) Horizontal Parallelism:\n- Splits specific layers or model components horizontally\n- Different devices handle different dimensions or segments of layer computations\n\n3. Advantages:\n- Enables training of extremely large models\n- Reduces memory bottlenecks\n- Allows scaling beyond single-device limitations\n\n4. Challenges:\n- Communication overhead between devices\n- Complex synchronization requirements\n- Potential performance inefficiencies\n\n5. Implementation Techniques:\n- Pipeline parallelism\n- Tensor parallelism\n- 3D parallelism (combining multiple strategies)\n\nFrameworks like DeepSpeed, Megatron-LM, and PyTorch's native distributed libraries support advanced MPC techniques.\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of Model Parallel Computing in LLMs?"
